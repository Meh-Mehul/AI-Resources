# Introduction
This is a resource bank (or a guidance document) for those who want to start/advance in the field of Artificial Intelligence for the purpose of participating in Tech Hackathons and solving Problem Statements.

It is observed that, each year its almost certain that at least one PS comes from this vast field of AI. We have tried to compile most of the resource you will need to work with such problem statements, but due to the vastness of this field, we cant tag each and every exact topic, so try making out a habit to search on Google Scholar or arxiv about the advancements done in a specific field to get idea about the SOTA (State of the Art) models in such fields.

# Before You Start
If you already have some idea about the topics mentioned in the following sections, you may skip them. Your goal must not be to complete all resources as fast as possible, instead it should be to perfect yourself in the fields of your choice first, and then try to check out other fields as well. It very well could be that this year’s PS does not involve Deep Learning at all! Still studying it is better for your knowledge development and future preparations as well.

All the best for your journey in AI!
### Update!

Here is one good playlist to get you interested in AI (For those who are just starting):

# Machine Learning -- 2nd Years may skip
Before diving into deep learning, you'll need a basic foundation in mathematics (Linear Algebra) and statistics (DS-2). Beyond your coursework, the following resources can help you master these concepts 

(Note: Please read the note written for each of the resource and only then decide to watch it).

1. 100 Days of Machine Learning:
    
    This one is highly recommended. But you don’t need to watch all of the videos, you can skip some videos that are related to data-handling if you want. This playlist will give you an idea of how basic Machine Learning techniques work, how to implement them in code, and how they rely on maths.

(For those who want to go in-depth, this is not-necessary for further topics)

1. Linear Algebra (Gil-Strang): https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLE7DDD91010BC51F8&feature=shared
2. Statistics and Probability: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP60hI9ATjSFgLZpbNJ7myAg6&feature=shared
3. Introduction to Statistical Learning (Book): https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~rabbee/s154/ISLR_First_Printing.pdf


# Deep Learning — Must have some idea at least
Assuming you have covered the above section or already have an idea about it, now you can start learning about Deep Learning. Kindly note that Deep Learning requires a LOT of Linear Algebra (mostly fundamental concepts covered in course) so if you are not well-versed in it, please watch above playlist for Linear Algebra to get a good idea. 

Now you can go one of the three paths:

1. CS-7015 — For pure theoretical idea:
    
    This is what almost everyone studies if they want to get an idea of theory of DL, in fact it does not even require much knowledge of Machine Learning. Highly recommended.
    
    https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEAYkSg4uSQ1r-2XrJ_GBzzS6I-f8yfRU&feature=shared
    
2. (Recommended) 3b1b — For intuition :
    
    This mini-playlist is for getting an intuition about what’s going on inside Deep neural Nets
    
    https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcCe-ymWq77ow42k4-ZrLzlM3F7Ha7smT&feature=shared
    
3. (Important) Pytorch Tutorial — For application*:
    
    This playlist will teach you how to make and train you own custom models, from simple ANNs to Complex YOLO models. But there is a big asterisk, you need some prior knowledge on these topics to efficiently learn from this playlist.

(More resources if you are a nerd):

(Best) Deep Learning Ian Goodfellow : https://www.deeplearningbook.org/ or get it from library.

## Intermission
Now, next step in Deep Learning either can be going into more generative models or delving into its advanced Topics.

# Generative AI
Now, before you start studying GenAI, i must tell you first that there are two very different notions of Generative AI people generally use in real life when studying, one is the field where you use GenAI models and add functionality on top of them to adapt to various real-world tasks (the RAG one), and the other, where you study the actual in-depth structure of these generative Models (Theoretical guys). Honestly speaking, you don’t need knowledge of one to be good in the other.

1. (V.V. Imp!) Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): RAG is one of the most prominent GenAI 

framework with wide applications in real life. It leverages models like LLMs to provide the user with contextually aware and quality answers.  Here is a playlist that will help you understand its various nuances and how to implement it yourself: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZePYakcDhmiPg-5JGfu20RaFV9RT_PQl&feature=shared

This playlist covers every topic you need to understand while starting to work with RAG pipelines. It also touches upon fine tuning Large language models and when it is better to use fine tuning instead of RAGs. 

1. (Good) After getting a decent understanding of vanilla RAG, you can dive into GraphRAGs that use knowledge graphs to store information instead of vector stores. Here is a video you can watch to get a basic understanding: https://youtu.be/knDDGYHnnSI?feature=shared
2. (Rare) Here is the resource i would recommend if you wanted to study the GenAI model in (very) depth: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ2ps__7DhBa5xCmncgH7kPqLqMBq7xlu

This playlist covers all important GenAI models (some of which you might never study in any course at IIT Mandi!). It even covers the alignment techniques of Reinforcement Learning with Language Models! (although very less chance of coming in a PS ).

# Advanced Topics
(CV, YOLO, Sim, etc)

#### Update!

Do the following also before starting RL (basics + intro):

Here are some resources for that:

# P.S.

If you like reading books and not watching videos and  just want to do ONE Book to get most basics in all fields of AI (yes, even the old heuristic algorithms!), the following book is highly recommended: (Russel and Norvig’s epic book on AI, try the new version if you find that)
